        <h2>Game Designer and Programmer</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! I'm a senior at New York University majoring in Game Design.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm very experienced in working with Unity and C# and particularly enjoy building systems and tuning game feel. I've also worked with Maya3D, Substance Painter, and Adobe Photoshop.
